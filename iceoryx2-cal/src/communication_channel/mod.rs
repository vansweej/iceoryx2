//! A [`CommunicationChannel`] is identified by a name and allows two processes to communicate
//! with each other (inter-process communication).
//!
//! It consists of exactly one [`CommunicationChannelReceiver`] which can be created with the
//! [`CommunicationChannelCreator`] and exactly one
//! [`CommunicationChannelSender`] which can be created with the [`CommunicationChannelConnector`].
//!
//! A [`CommunicationChannel`] has to fulfill the following contract:
//!  * zero sized names are not valid
//!  * **unique:** multiple [`CommunicationChannel`]s with the same name cannot be created
//!  * the receiver always creates the [`CommunicationChannel`]
//!  * the sender always opens the [`CommunicationChannel`]
//!  * non-existing [`CommunicationChannel`]s cannot be opened
//!  * the communication must have fifo behavior
//!  * the default receiver buffer size must be at least [`DEFAULT_RECEIVER_BUFFER_SIZE`]
//!  * must be able to transmit at least u64 values (larger more complex values are allowed as well)
//!  * The [`CommunicationChannelSender`] must be able to handle a [`CommunicationChannelReceiver`]
//!    which removes the underlying channel.
//!
//! The contract is verified by the corresponding unit tests. Every [`CommunicationChannel`] must
//! pass the test.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use iceoryx2_bb_system_types::file_name::FileName;
//! use iceoryx2_bb_container::semantic_string::SemanticString;
//! use iceoryx2_cal::communication_channel::*;
//! use iceoryx2_cal::named_concept::*;
//!
//! // the following two functions can be implemented in different processes
//! fn process_one<Channel: CommunicationChannel<u64>>() {
//!     let channel_name = FileName::new(b"myChannelName").unwrap();
//!     let mut receiver = Channel::Creator::new(&channel_name).create_receiver().unwrap();
//!
//!     println!("Create channel {}", receiver.name());
//!     match receiver.receive().unwrap() {
//!         Some(data) => println!("Received {:?}", data),
//!         None => println!("Received nothing")
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn process_two<Channel: CommunicationChannel<u64>>() {
//!     let channel_name = FileName::new(b"myChannelName").unwrap();
//!     let mut sender = Channel::Connector::new(&channel_name).open_sender().unwrap();
//!     let data: u64 = 1238712390;
//!
//!     println!("Open channel {}", sender.name());
//!     match sender.send(&data).is_ok() {
//!         true => println!("Sent {}", data),
//!         false => println!("Unable to send data. Receiver queue full?"),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
