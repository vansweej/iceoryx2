//! Traits that provide modifyable memory which can be accessed by multiple processes
//! identified by a name.
//!
//! A [`DynamicStorage`] has to fulfill the following contract:
//!  * zero sized names are not valid
//!  * **unique:** multiple [`DynamicStorage`]s with the same cannot be created
//!  * non-existing [`DynamicStorage`]s cannot be opened
//!
//! The contract is verified by the corresponding unit tests. Every [`DynamicStorage`] must
//! pass the test.
//!
//! **Important:** It is not the task of the [`DynamicStorage`] to ensure a thread-safe access to
//! the underlying object. If the [`DynamicStorage`] is used in an inter-process environment every
//! access must be considered as a concurrent access!
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use iceoryx2_bb_system_types::file_name::FileName;
//! use iceoryx2_bb_container::semantic_string::SemanticString;
//! use iceoryx2_cal::dynamic_storage::*;
//! use iceoryx2_cal::named_concept::*;
//! use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};
//!
//! // the following two functions can be implemented in different processes
//! fn process_one<Storage: DynamicStorage<AtomicU64>>() {
//!     let storage_name = FileName::new(b"myStorageName").unwrap();
//!     let mut storage = Storage::Builder::new(&storage_name)
//!                         .create(AtomicU64::new(873)).unwrap();
//!
//!     println!("Created storage {}", storage.name());
//!     storage.get().store(991, Ordering::Relaxed);
//! }
//!
//! fn process_two<Storage: DynamicStorage<AtomicU64>>() {
//!     let storage_name = FileName::new(b"myStorageName").unwrap();
//!     let mut storage = Storage::Builder::new(&storage_name)
//!                         .open().unwrap();
//!
//!     println!("Opened storage {}", storage.name());
//!     println!("Current value {}", storage.get().swap(1001, Ordering::Relaxed));
//! }
//! ```
