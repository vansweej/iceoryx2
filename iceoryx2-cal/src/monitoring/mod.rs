//! Allows one process to monitor the state of another process. Can detect if the process is
//! [`State::Alive`], [`State::Dead`] or the existance with [`State::DoesNotExist`]. To activate
//! monitoring the process that shall be monitored must instantiate a [`MonitoringToken`]. As long
//! as the [`MonitoringToken`] is in scope the [`MonitoringMonitor`] will detect the process as
//! [`State::Alive`]. When the process crashes it will be detected as [`State::Dead`]. If the
//! process does not yet have instantiated a [`MonitoringMonitor`] the process is identified as
//! [`State::DoesNotExist`].
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use iceoryx2_cal::monitoring::*;
//!
//! fn monitored_process<M: Monitoring>() {
//!     let token =
//!     M::Builder::new(&FileName::new(b"unique_process_identifier").unwrap()).
//!                         token().unwrap();
//!
//!     // keep the token in scope and do what a process shall do
//!
//!     // process can no longer be monitored
//!     drop(token);
//! }
//!
//! fn watching_process<M: Monitoring>() {
//!     let monitor = M::Builder::new(&FileName::new(b"unique_process_identifier").unwrap()).

//!
//!     match monitor.state().unwrap() {
