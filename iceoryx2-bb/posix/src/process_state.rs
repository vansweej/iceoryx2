//! Process monitoring via holding a file lock of a specific file. If the process crashes the
//! lock will be released by the operating system and another process can detect the crash. If the
//! process shutdowns correctly the file is removed and another process detects the clean shutdown.

//! # Example
//!
//! ## Application (That Shall Be Monitored)
//!
//! ```
//! use iceoryx2_bb_posix::process_state::*;

//!                 // we own the stale resources and have to remove them
//!                 // as soon as the guard goes out of scope the process state file is removed
//!                 drop(cleaner);
//!
//!                 match ProcessGuard::new(&process_state_path) {
//!                     Ok(guard) => guard,

//!                 // wait a bit and try again

//! ## Watchdog (Process That Monitors The State Of Other Processes)
