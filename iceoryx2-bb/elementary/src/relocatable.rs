/// Marks types that can be safely used from within different process address spaces.
///
/// # Safety
///
///  * The types must be self-contained, meaning they shall not contain pointer, references,
///    indices or handles that are identifying resources outside of the struct.
///    Examples:
///       * File descriptors point to resources that can be different in another process.
///       * A list with pointers into the heap.
///  * The type must have a uniform memory representation, meaning they are annotated with
///    `#[repr(C)]`
///  * The type does not have references or pointer members. It shall not use pointers to manage
///    its internal structure.
///    Examples:
///       * A list must be implemented using indices to structure itself.
